Kira is building the first truly decentralized Interchain Exchange that requires no middleman between blockchain and user.

Kira is a next-generation hyperscale decentralized exchange (DEX)
engineered for cross-chain transfers and frictionless trading. On one
hand, Kira aims to deliver all the liquidity, performance and trading
the sophistication of a centralized exchange but without the custody,
downtime and fraud risk that plague our industry. On the other hand,
Kira offers stronger security guarantees than state-of-the-art DEXs
with a powerful governance model that builds trust and engagement
whilst actively resisting corruption.
