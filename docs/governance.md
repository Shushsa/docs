## Q1: What is Kira’s governance structure?

The governance set of Kira consists of the following two kinds of actors:

1. Validators - these have equal voting power to all other members of the governance set and they 
   can vote VETO on governance proposals. Validators account for >= 1/3rd of all governance seats. 
   To vote, they must also be active operators and not 'jailed', that is, currently being penalized 
   for an infraction. 

2. Council Members - these actors do not operate validator nodes. They have equal voting power to all other governance 
   members but can NOT vote VETO on governance proposals. Counselors account for < 2/3'rds of all governance seats.

## Q2: Why should I become a Kira partner?

Becoming a partner enables you to participate (as a validator) in the 'token mining'
event that will occur at the launch of the Kira network. You'll also be able to earn revenue from block, 
network and exchange fee rewards, as well as mining the KEX token itself. In addition to becoming a validator, 
partners will also be granted a governance seat. 

Additionally, partners benefit from tailored agreements with the Kira Team, such as 
customization of the token issuance module, long term support (LTS) for our open-source 
development stack and whitelisting of tokens for Multi Bonded Proof of Stake consensus. The 
latter enables partners to earn a share of exchange revenues, however, partners cannot mine, or acquire, 
any more tokens than any other validator.

## Q3: So, council members are not required to be validators? What are the requirements?

Initially, the governance set will consist only of validators, but eventually, additional 
members will be elected. These actors, called counselors, are not validators but may vote on 
governance proposals. In order to become a counselor one must meet the requirements set out in 
the Code of Conduct, and adhere to these rules when elected. The Code of Conduct will be created 
(and curated) by the initial governance set and will detail obligations such as providing 
utility to the network, possessing certain technical skills that will benefit the Kira ecosystem, 
and many further requirements that will be decided upon in the spirit of creating a technocratic 
system of governance.

## Q4: Where does the governance for Kira’s IBC logic happens?

Governance always happens on the most secure layer. It's a master-slave approach to
governance, regardless of what is decided on the hub zones have to comply with it, unless they
are just private chains or foreign bridges with independent security model.
Zones could have a margin of independence but even in such cases, they would be managed
through the hub. Exchange application has to be as lightweight as possible, especially in the
context of later implementing privacy features. The beauty of the Internet Blockchain Communication
is that important governance decisions can be taken on the more secure layers and applied to
less secure ones.

## Q5: What is Technocracy?

In the context of Kira, technocracy is a governance system where voting power is not
proportional to your wealth but distributed equally among most technically skilled and trusted
actors in the network who provide their input and help Kira constantly progress and expand.
Stake can still be bonded to those validators in exchange for the proportional amount of rewards for
the delegators but voting power are equal among entire governance set which prevents the
vulnerabilities due to stake centralization.

## Q6: What is enlightened democracy?

The enlightened democracy is the next stage of evolution in the technocracy governance
system. During the technocracy era, only validators can vote on governance proposals to evolve, manage and improving the network. This initial set of validators is
technically inclined set of actors operating and governing the network in accordance with the Code
of Conduct. These actors will begin to elect new governance set members called “Counselors”
who are chain conscious, and provide valuable technical and nontechnical input in regards to
the network operations. Counselors are not validators and cannot propose new blocks. Once
the number of counselors is greater than the number of validators in the governance set, the
network is transformed from the technocratic to the enlightened democracy system, where non
purely technical but chain conscious actors have full governance power over the network.
