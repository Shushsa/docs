## Q1: "What is Kira’s governance structure?"
Governance set of Kira consists of the following two kinds of actors:
1. Validators - must be active operators and not jailed. They have equal voting power to all
other governance set members. Can vote VETO on governance proposals. (1/2 of all
validators required). Validators will account for >= 1/3rd of all governance seats.
2. Council Members - do not operate a validator node. They have equal voting power to all
other governance set members but can NOT vote VETO on governance proposals.
Counselors account for < 2/3'rds of all governance seats.

## Q2: "Why should I become a Kira partner?"
Becoming a Kira Partner allows you to participate as a validator in the token mining
event during the launch of the network and earn revenue from block, network and exchange fee
rewards as well as mining KEX token. In addition to becoming a validator, partners will also be
automatically granted a governance seat position. Additionally partners benefit from individual
agreements with the Kira Team, such as customization of the token issuance module, LTS of the
open source development stack being delivered by the Kira Team, whitelisting tokens of our
partners as stake-able assets in the context of Kira’s Multi Bonded Proof of Stake consensus,
thus allowing them to earn a portion of the revenue from the exchange. However, partners
cannot mine or acquire any more tokens than any other validator.

## Q3: "So council members are not required to be validators? What are the requirements to be one?"
Council members are not validators. Initially, governance set will consist of only
validators, eventually they will start electing additional members to the governance set, who are
not validators but can vote on the governance proposals. Those actors are called counsellors. In
order to become a counsellor you have to meet the requirements in the Code of Conduct, and
follow it after your election. Code of Conduct will be created and curated by the initial
governance set, and will detail requirements such as providing utility to the network, possessing
certain technical skills that will benefit the Kira Network, or others to be decided in the spirit of
the technocratic governance system.

## Q4: "Where does the governance for Kira’s IBC logic happens?"
Governance always happens on the most secure layer. It's a master-slave approach to
governance, regardless of what is decided on the hub zones have to comply with it, unless they
are just private chains or foreign bridges with independent security model.
Zones could have a margin of independence but even in such cases they would be managed
through the hub. Exchange application has to be as lightweight as possible, especially in the
context of later implementing privacy features. Beauty of the Internet Blockchain Communication
is that important governance decisions can be taken on the more secure layers and applied to
less secure ones.

## Q5: "What is Technocracy?"
In the context of Kira, technocracy is a governance system where voting power is not
proportional to your wealth but distributed equally among most technically skilled and trusted
actors in the network who provide their input and help Kira constantly progress and expand.
Stake can still be bonded to those validators in exchange for proportional amount of rewards for
the delegators but voting power is equal among entire governance set which prevents the
vulnerabilities due to stake centralization.

## Q6: "What is enlightened democracy?"
The enlightened democracy is the next stage of evolution in technocracy governance
system. During the technocracy era only validators can vote on governance proposals for the
purpose of evolving, managing and improving the network. This initial set of validators is
technically inclined set of actors operating and governing the network in accordance to the Code
of Conduct. These actors will begin to elect new governance set members called “Counselors”
who are chain conscious, and provide valuable technical and non technical input in regards of
the network operations. Counsellors are not validators and cannot propose new blocks. Once
the number of counsellors is greater than amount of validators in the governance set, the
network is transformed from the technocratic to the enlightened democracy system, where non
purely technical but chain conscious actors have full governance power over the network.
