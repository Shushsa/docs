## Q1: What is Kira’s governance structure?

The governance set of Kira consists of the following two kinds of actors:

1. Validators - these have equal voting power to all other members of the governance set and they 
   can vote VETO on governance proposals. Validators account for >= 1/3rd of all governance seats. 
   To vote, they must also be active operators and not 'jailed', that is, currently being penalized 
   for an infraction. 

2. Council Members - these actors do not operate validator nodes. They have equal voting power to all other governance 
   members but can NOT vote VETO on governance proposals. Counselors account for < 2/3'rds of all governance seats.

## Q2: Why should I become a Kira partner?

Becoming a partner enables you to participate (as a validator) in the 'token mining'
event that will occur at the launch of the Kira network. You'll also be able to earn revenue from block, 
network and exchange fee rewards, as well as mining the KEX token itself. In addition to becoming a validator, 
partners will also be granted a governance seat. 

Additionally, partners benefit from tailored agreements with the Kira Team, such as 
customization of the token issuance module, long term support (LTS) for our open-source 
development stack and whitelisting of tokens for Multi Bonded Proof of Stake consensus. The 
latter enables partners to earn a share of exchange revenues, however, partners cannot mine, or acquire, 
any more tokens than any other validator.

## Q3: So, council members are not required to be validators? What are the requirements?

Initially, the governance set will consist only of validators, but eventually, additional 
members will be elected. These actors, called counselors, are not validators but may vote on 
governance proposals. In order to become a counselor one must meet the requirements set out in 
the Code of Conduct, and adhere to these rules when elected. The Code of Conduct will be created 
(and curated) by the initial governance set and will detail obligations such as providing 
utility to the network, possessing certain technical skills that will benefit the Kira ecosystem, 
and many further requirements that will be decided upon in the spirit of creating a technocratic 
system of governance.

## Q4: Where does the governance for Kira’s IBC logic happen?

Governance always operates on the most secure layer. We employ a master-slave approach to
governance, so all zones must comply with whatever is decided on the hub, unless they
are private chains or foreign bridges with an independent security model. The beauty of IBC 
is that important governance decisions can be taken on the most secure layers and applied to 
the less secure ones.

Zones can have a margin of independence, but even in these cases, the overall bounds would be managed
via the hub. The exchange application must to be as lightweight as possible, which will become 
especially important as we implement privacy features in the future. 

## Q5: What is 'Technocracy'?

In the context of Kira, technocracy describes a system of governance where voting power is not
proportional to wealth, but instead, is distributed equally amongst most technically skilled and trusted
actors in the network. These individuals can be counted upon to provide guidance and to help the Kira 
project evolve and expand. Stake can still be bonded to those validators (by delegators) in exchange for 
a proportional share of rewards, but the voting power of all members of the governance set remains 
uniform. This also serves to mitigate vulnerabilities that can arise due to centralization of stake.

## Q6: What is enlightened democracy?

The enlightened democracy is the next stage of evolution in the technocracy governance
system. During the technocracy era, only validators can vote on governance proposals to evolve, manage and improving the network. This initial set of validators is
technically inclined set of actors operating and governing the network in accordance with the Code
of Conduct. These actors will begin to elect new governance set members called “Counselors”
who are chain conscious, and provide valuable technical and nontechnical input in regards to
the network operations. Counselors are not validators and cannot propose new blocks. Once
the number of counselors is greater than the number of validators in the governance set, the
network is transformed from the technocratic to the enlightened democracy system, where non
purely technical but chain conscious actors have full governance power over the network.
