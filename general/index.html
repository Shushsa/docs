<p>Our architecture employs a hybrid of two quite different consensuses mechanisms; Multi Bonded Proof of Stake and Multi Bonded Proof
of Authority. The former guarantees the security of the settlement layer and the latter provides extremely high transaction

<p>Kira's native staking asset is called the Kira Exchange Token (KEX). KEX is used to
secure the network, and delegating KEX yields block rewards, network fees and exchange fees
for stakeholders. KEX also powers the on-chain contracting mechanism via the community fund and
is used in the permissionless token issuance process.</p>

<p>All KEX tokens will be created through the direct or indirect process of mining. The direct
process involves operating a validator node, during the testnet and incubation phase of the Kira
Network launch. The indirect method of mining will be disclosed at a later date and will be fully
permissionless. During the mining phase, KEX tokens will be created through the dynamic
inflation process, which is required to ensure the security of the network.</p>

<p>Bonding is needed to ensure “value” is at stake of the Proof of Stake consensus. When
assets are “at stake” it means that if the validator to whom the stake is bonded misbehaves,
those bonded assets can be destroyed. This ensures that delegators (those who bond stake)
wisely choose validators to who commit their assets.</p>

<p>In the context of the Multi-Bonded Proof of Stake consensus, multiple tokens are used to
ensure security and long term decentralization of the network. Every token always centralizes
overtime, for these reasons instead of using a single token, Kira uses many tokens that are
constantly changing to ensure that stake in the network is never centralized to the point which
could decrease the security of the network.</p>
<p>Tokens used for staking have to be whitelisted because the value of the stake has to be pegged
to the value of the native stake-able token KEX, as well as defining the maximum revenue share
that not native staked assets can access. Otherwise, a malicious actor could print and inject an
infinite amount of token within Kira to claim most of the revenue from staking.</p>

<p>Parallelization is achieved when trading occurs in many different zones at the same time. You can pick any zone you want for trading and different currency pairs can be traded on different zones allowing for user experience comparable to one on a centralized exchange, but where user still maintains custody over the funds.</p>

<p>Users, who are not validators and do not own the Kira Exchange Token (KEX) can bond
all other stake-able assets and earn revenue from the block rewards, network fees, and
exchange fees. Staked assets will be transferable in the form of delegation shares, which implies
that users can generate passive income while trading or simply holding their assets.</p>

<p>Cosmos is a tool used to launch Kira in a fast and painless manner, with the assumption that
crypto is moving toward the Internet of Blockchain. This implies not only trustless bridges to largest
chains like BTC and ETH but also all new projects will be launching using various SDK's and
creating reusable modules instead of forking some legacy coin code and continuously rewriting
and the bug-fixing entire thing. In case of Cosmos BTC and ETH bridges are almost complete and
will be out EOY 2019 along IBC.</p>
<p>Previous paradigms occurred first on various forks of PoW, then on the smart contact level. The
new trend is Proof of Stake consensus and Internet of Blockchains, and this makes total sense
from the perspective of developers who want to rapidly deliver blockchain apps that actually
work and scale in real life scenarios. Which implies that in not so distant future, majority of
tokens will be available or created within the IoB. Kira will allow for all those assets to trade in a
fully trustless and permissionless manner.</p>
<p>It’s extremely important that PoS tokens have a trustless and permissionless access to the
market, due to how the PoS consensus is secured - through the assumption that stake-able
assets have value. If this value could NOT be possible to realize because centralized exchange
began to delist PoS tokens, the PoS security of all those delisted tokens would be immensely
decreased. For this reason, Kira is an essential part of sustaining the Proof of Stake paradigm.</p>

<p>Before any asset can be traded on the Kira Exchange it has to be sent through the IBC

<p>Kira’s development team will also be employed under this onchain contract and initially
will be responsible for the majority of those bigger features. While the smaller ones will be
outsourced through the community fund as well. In addition, there’s going to be a code of
conduct under which all governance bodies vote and decide how funds are distributed. You
have to consider, that before the network fully transforms into enlightened democracy, where
people are “chain conscious” and aware of issues like these, the network will be a technocracy,
which implies that people with short term visions will unlikely enter a governance set</p>

<p>Yes, except for the fees. The 50% of the fees goes to the validator that proposes the
block and the rest goes to delegators but the funds that go to the delegators are distributed
differently than block rewards. They are not proportional to your stake in regards to all coins
staked. Your fee rewards are proportional to your stake bonded to the particular validator which
is the similar way how it’s done in polkadot, it’s just a mix of both polkadot distribution (of fee
rewards) and cosmos distribution (of block rewards).</p>

<p>Kira believes that both delegators and validators have equally important roles. The
delegators provide security and have to be incentivized, while validators operate the network for
everyone to use. These roles are distinct, and are equally valuable. That's why we set that initial
cosmological constant to be 50%.
Governance set will always be able to decide upon any parameter, however, that’s why we have
a code of conduct to ensure that things like that are not abused. It’s similar in case of cosmos
network. If governance decides to change any variable, they could easily do it. It’s a default
setting, however, the assumption is that this ratio would rather decrease than grow. There has to be
a reasonable value under which the network starts operating. Such as supply of tokens, inflation,
and hundreds of other parameters you set in the beginning. Although no one can guess how
the market is going to react, it will definitely show us its expectations.</p>

Meaning, 1 wallet with 1 KEX will have exact same voting power as 1 wallet with 1 million KEX?</h2>
<p>There are two cases where voting power applies, that is the governance and chances to
propose new blocks by each validator. In both cases, Kira, validators and council members have
an equal voting power, regardless of the stake bonded. Kira is a technocracy, aiming to evolve
into the enlightened democracy governance system.
This means that voting power is in the hands of people who have knowledge and skills, useful for the project - rather than those who
only have wealth. Enlightened democracy is the case where the majority of actors become network
conscious to the similar level as initial governance set but that’s a long term process of
educating the user base.</p>
